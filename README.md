# Loan-Repayment-Tracker-using-Python
Developed a Python OOP-based Loan Repayment Tracker with detailed amortization schedules. Integrated into a Streamlit app to simulate EMI plans, visualize repayment breakdowns via interactive charts, and enable CSV export for detailed financial analysis. 

This project was born from my own idea — I wanted to build something real that reflects both my curiosity and the skills I’ve gained over the past 6 months of Python learning.

I didn’t just want to stop at learning syntax or solving tutorials.
So I decided to apply my learnings practically, by exploring how I could turn a basic finance concept (loan repayment) into a working tool — something useful.

Working on this helped me:

Think beyond code and understand user perspective

Dive into new tools like Streamlit, beyond the Python basics

Explore how data flows, how visuals help, and how apps are structured

Push myself to see what I could actually build with what I’ve learned

This wasn’t an assignment — it was a personal challenge to test my growth.
And I’m proud to say: I built this from scratch.
